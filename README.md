PokePaths: Call an API and show the results

This is a coding challenge for a job application.  It acceses their API, and uses the results to show an animation.

To install and run:

1: Use a recent version of Node.  There is strange behavior on Node ~6. 
2: Clone the repo.
3: cd into the directory 'paths-home': cd paths-home 
4: Install the necessary dependencies with the command: npm install
4: Run the command: 'npm run start' to see the demo work locally.
5: This should open a browser to view the project, but if not: 
   Open a browser window and direct it to http://localhost:3000
