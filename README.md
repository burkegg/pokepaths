3: cd into the directory 'paths-home': cd paths-home  
4: Install the necessary dependencies with the command: npm install.  
4: Run the command: 'npm run start' to see the demo work locally.

   Open a browser window and direct it to http://localhost:3000  

### To use:

1: Type in a size for the grid, between 2 and 10 (inclusive).  
2: Use the dropdown menu to place start and end points.
3: You can also place or remove obstacles with the dropdown menu.
4: After both a start point and end point have been selected,
   a new button will appear to show you the route home.  
5: If you created an unsolveable route, you should see a message telling you so.  You can edit the size of the grid to start over.
